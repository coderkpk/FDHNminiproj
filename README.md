# FDHNminiproj

Implemented a Fuzzy Deep Hybrid Network (FDHN) for fake news detection, integrating 
BERT, TextCNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and fuzzy logic to process semantic, contextual, and 
numerical inputs. Enhanced model accuracy and interpretability on the LIAR and LIAR2 
benchmark datasets. Focused on multi-modal data fusion, uncertainty handling, and 
robust classification.
